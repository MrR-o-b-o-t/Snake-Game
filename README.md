## Summary

Don't have an old flip phone lying around? I have you covered! This is a classic Snake Game I built using JavaScript, HTML5, Canvas, and CSS3. This project put my problem solving skills to the test as I had no experience with Canvas and did not reference tutorials of any kind. 

The hardest part of getting this game to function properly was the snake movement. Really taking time to understand what I wanted the snake to do (move like links in a chain), writting good pseudo-code and LOTS of trial and error made this all come together awesome in the end!
